        Do you remember when I first started calling you baby? 🫣 Our first fight
        was over Chhota Bheem and Ben 10 😂 Then it turned into drama vs anime
        😤🎭 And you—acting all cute and stubborn like a baby—just to win the
        argument 😝 That’s when I started calling you baby ❤️ And
        now….................
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Do you know why I’m not mad (thettal) at you? 😏 Because you can’t
        handle my love ❤️ When I sent you my love rain 🌧️ you caught a fever for
        two days 🤒 My thettal is more powerful and dangerous than my love 💥
        You can’t handle that, my little baby boy 😘💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When you said that you think about me when you see a couple feeding each
        other and holding hands… awww, my heart started fluttering like a tiny
        butterfly 🦋💞 You have no idea how sweet that felt from behind the
        phone 😚💖
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When you said even looking at other chicks reminds you of me telling you
        not to… my heart just melted 🥺💗 Little things like that make me love
        you more and more every single time 🦋💞
      </div>

      <div className={`${boxStyle} italic`}>
        I love it when you act a little mad whenever I say ‘bro,’ ‘M,’ or ‘hm’
        😝 It’s honestly adorable… but the moment you call me ‘sis,’ it totally
        kills the vibe 😩💞 And when you say you like to disturb me — ughh, I
        secretly love that too 😚💗
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        The scene I imagine the most is being with you at the beach under the
        moonlight — you giving me Dairy Milk Hazelnut, drinking your chikku
        shake, and that tiny fight we had… it’s my favorite memory even if it
        was just in my mind 🥺
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        You know what? If I could, I’d erase that whole chapter with Besty from
        your life. I don’t like it — not even a little. The part where she gave
        you Dairy Milk and you gave her a dress? I can’t stand that. And the
        thought of you at the beach with her? I just can’t accept it. She’s the
        one I hate the most, for no reason… maybe just because she was with you
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I don’t like it when you mention other girls 😤 Even when you say you’re
        a mumma’s boy, it makes me a little mad 😅💞 And when you talk about
        that girly tiger, I really don’t like it 😤 So tell me 🤨 — how am I
        supposed to stay calm when you say you notice girls wearing chudidars,
        light makeup, a nose piercing, and natural lips? 😩 Every time you say
        that, I feel like coming over with some Clorox or cleaner to wipe your
        eyes, mind, and heart spotless 😤
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Even on those days when you don’t message me the whole day, it feels
        like something’s missing 😔💗 I know you’re busy, but try telling that
        to my heart too — it just doesn’t listen 🥺💞 Still, I love how you give
        those full explanations before going out or when you get busy — even
        without me asking — like a cute little report 😝 But when I ask you to
        sing and you don’t… that’s the only explanation I can’t accept — it
        makes me a little sad 🥺🎶💞
      </div>

      <div className={`${boxStyle} italic`}>
        I don’t care if it’s your past, Ex, Bestie or another lifetime — you’re
        not allowed to call anyone pretty, beautiful, or gorgeous, baby, ever
        again! 😤💗 And if those eyes even dare to look at someone else without
        permission, I swear I’ll come over and push you straight into a
        pottakinar myself 😆 From now on, those eyes only see me — got it? 😏💞
        Those words belong to me now. They were made only to call your Bubu!
        😚💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        But the thing I don’t like is how you make me mad and then totally
        forget about it 😤 You know I’m mad, yet you still ask, ‘Kalippilano?’
        like you don’t already know! 😂 You literally know everything — places
        100 km away in Kasaragod, you can reach anywhere without even knowing
        the language 😏 And somehow, without even knowing who those chicks are,
        your eyes still manage to look at them 🙄 But Mr. Genius, you still
        don’t know why I’m mad or the reason behind it… right? 😤💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I’ll never forget the day I shared that reel — I felt jealousy burning
        like fire just thinking about those chicks😡🔥. Then you mentioned the
        person I hate the most, your bestie’s name😡😤, and even Hinata — you
        remembered everything about her, and I didn’t like that at all Okay
        BAABBYYY😠
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Do you remember you talked about an aunty who wears a nose piercing and
        said that’s the kind of look you like. You called her cute, beautiful,
        and wonderful — you even said you didn’t have words to describe her🤨. I
        felt so mad at that moment, but I tried to stay calm. But when you said
        that sleep isn’t an issue when you talk to her — that dialogue made me
        lose my mind👺 It drove me crazy😠; Appo anikki neritt vann kannil
        kuthanam nn indarnnn😁 After I got mad and went offline, you probably
        thought I took it too seriously🫣Later, when we sorted things out, you
        didn’t talk to me like you usually do🥹 You went offline early, and
        instead of saying ‘njn or karyam parayatte?’ like you always do, you
        just said you were sleepy😓 and wished me good night. That day, for the
        first time, I felt like I made you sad… like I annoyed or disturbed you
        somehow😔😢
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Then I told you to send a voice note — like you were all shocked 😳
        after hearing my proposal 😝But you didn’t send it! 🥴I even started a
        fight about it 😤 and still, no voice message! 🎙️You knew exactly why I
        was angry 😡💔So tell me… why didn’t you send it, huh? 👀That question
        is still running circles in my mind 🧠💭😂
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
      You know… I felt a little spark when you replied to my hazelnut proposal 😁
I actually wanted you to act all shocked, like you were hearing it for the first time 😝 but I didn’t tell you that that day…

And then you said,
“You’ll buy me Dairy Milk, but I have to give you a kiss for every bite.” 😳😘
Baby… I literally got that tiny butterfly effect for like 2 seconds 🦋🫣
Because that was the first time you ever talked about a kiss 😌💗

I didn’t save the voice because I wasn’t sure what you’d think if I did…🫣
But I really, really loved that reply🤗 Honestly, that was the moment I felt something for you for the first time, baby🥰
But still… I loved the way you acted shocked in your own cute style, my duuuuduuu 😜💗
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I already hated your bestie… but then you had to say she’s your only —
        and in that deep voice too! 😤 I don’t even know how mad I got, I swear
        I was ready to come over and put chilli powder in your eyes and mouth
        myself! 🌶️😂 Then you said her song is THARAATT — and you didn’t even
        mention me there, right? 😤 You went to the beach with her, bought her
        ice cream and spring potato, and when she said she was hungry, you even
        got her biriyani?! 😩 Everything else is fine — even the voice call… but
        how could you video call her? 🥹 I can’t accept that one, Dudu. Every
        time that thought pops up in my mind, it makes me feel something I can’t
        even explain 😔💗 And she even taught you cooking — that’s why your
        cooking isn’t that good now and you’ve turned all lazy in cooking 😝🔥💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        How can you even compare my sweet cutey, my own teddy, with your
        pinky-ponky Bestie? 😤 My teddy is mine forever — always with me, always
        by my side. But your Bestie? Hmm, she’s a little bitter and salty. All
        she can do is video call and voice call — while my teddy stays right
        here, close to my heart 🧸💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I say yes, it can mean no… when I say yes, it can mean yes🤯
        Sometimes yes means maybe😵… and no means no… but sometimes no means
        yes😲… or maybe😳. And maybe can mean yes, or no, or just maybe😵‍💫 — it
        all depends on the situation 🫣 You just have to understand what I really
        mean 😌 I thought you’d say “I can’t understand👀,” but instead you
        said, “I’ll try to understand” — that was so, so sweet of you, babyyy
        🥰😍
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I said to you, “Kashpettann, I drink water,” you said you don’t😔.
        Then you asked me, “Is there anything else I said that made you
        kashtapaad?🥺” That moment really touched me💘. I didn’t even say what I
        truly felt… I just stayed quiet🤐 but inside, I felt something — a
        little sad, a little heavy💔
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Baby, I really love your voice when you get possessive 😌 but I honestly
        don’t know if you’re actually possessive or just pretending. When I said
        if I have an ex, I had so many stories I could’ve told you — but I loved
        the way you reacted. Even if it wasn’t real, I didn’t expect that
        reaction from you ❤️
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Baby, when I said I decided to voice call, video call, and come to
        Valanchery — that was just to shock you 😌 I didn’t mean to give you
        hope. But honestly, deep inside, I really wanted to do it. I’ve never
        had a love before, so I’ve never done voice or video calls like that —
        maybe that’s why something held me back. But the truth is, I really
        wanted to call you too 💞
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I heard your first ‘hello’ on the call, my heart started fluttering
        ❤️ and for a moment I couldn’t even breathe 😮‍💨. My voice got stuck on my
        tongue, and when you asked me if I was shy, I actually blushed 🫣. And
        when you smiled… my heart stopped again 💓.That’s when I realized you
        can make my heart flutter and freeze at the same time — even through a
        phone call 🩷📞.And when you said, ‘If you call once, there’s no option
        of not calling again — you have to call,’ that touched me so deeply
        🥹💗.This is exactly how I felt on our first call.
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When you sent that picture of you and your bestie, I was already in a
        bad mood that day 😔. Honestly… I didn’t like her in that moment 😕. I
        was really jealous 🥺💔. You said you were experiencing all this for the
        first time with me, but when you said that you had openly spoken to her
        once, it made me feel something inside 😣. And the way you smiled in
        that picture 😊, and the way you talked about your bestie just to tease
        me… it made me even more jealous 😤💗. I know I reacted too strongly,
        and I’m really sorry for that 🫶🏼🥹
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I asked you to propose to me, the way you sounded… I liked it so
        much 😘 The way you said, “I didn’t fall but you tried” — nice, baby 😏
        And that “ham haaa mmm” you said… hilarious and so adorable 🤭 I really
        loved it😁 But still… you didn’t propose to me properly 🫤 This time you
        have to do it the right way. I’ll give you one more chance… if you want
        🫣 Will you do it correctly now, baby? 💞😉
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I love your sleepy voice… the way you sound when you’re half-asleep
        melts me completely 😴💗 It gives me a feeling I can’t even put into
        words, baby… it’s like your voice wraps around my heart. And when you
        suddenly stop talking, I miss you instantly 😔❤️ I just want to hear you
        again… even if it’s just one more soft, sleepy word from you.
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I don’t want someone in my life just to wake me up, make me sleep🌙, or
        just text me “gm" and “gn.” I don’t want a connection that’s only about
        voice calls or video calls📱. I want something deeper…❤️ I want someone
        like Gwansik — someone who admired Aesun till her very last breath🫶 I
        want someone who will admire me with that same depth, loyalty, and
        love💗✨
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When you suddenly asked me which flower I like, I just stopped for a
        moment… I didn’t even know how to explain what I felt 🥰 I told you that
        I’m the butterfl🦋and you’re the bouquet💐 so you wouldn’t notice that I
        suddenly got shy🫣
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        I got my first kiss on 17/Nov/25 at 9:48 pm😘 Do you want to know
        something, baby😌? I actually got stuck for a few seconds during the
        kiss 🦋 And do you even know… I got shy too🫣 I got that Adivayattil
        Manju Veena feeling 😁— soft, dreamy, magical 🎶💞 And with your sleepy
        voice note 😴💗… your love ❤️… your kiss 😘… awww baby🥰, I can’t even
        explain that feeling 🤯✨ It was just too special🥰
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I propose to you, I love the way you react through your voice 🥰
        It’s honestly amazing… even I get shy after hearing you 🫣 Every time I
        send you a video, I wait eagerly just to hear you say “Ante mwoleee”
        😍and “njan stuck aayi” 😍 If you don’t say it, I feel like something is
        missing in that video 🥹✨. And today… we talked for 42 minutes 📞💞. I
        enjoyed every second of it — your shy voice 😚, the way you searched for
        words 🤭, the little pauses… everything. Those tiny things are what make
        you my pookie🫰🏻🫶🏻. I also like your once more😁
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I was angry and I said, “If I caught you in my hand😡…,” you
        suddenly asked me, “Will you give me a kiss?” 😳 I said no… and then you
        said, “Will you hug me?” 🤗 Baby, at that moment I totally lost myself🫣
        Even though it’s just simple words—kiss and hug—when they come from you,
        there’s some kind of magic ✨❤️ Your words hit differently… they touch
        my heart every single time. 💖
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        When I told you that I’ll propose to you properly when we meet in
        person,👀 and you said you’ll definitely come, I felt like laughing a
        little 😅❤️ But honestly, the reality is different… I don’t even know if
        I’ll be able to look at you directly 😁 If you ask me whether I want to
        see you or not, I genuinely don’t have an answer 🤐💗. Because if you
        come… everything will change ✨ It won’t be just imagination anymore —
        it will become real 💞🌙.
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        The day you were preparing for your exam and presentation, you told me
        you missed me so much🥹… and it felt like many days passed without
        talking to me, even though it was just one night 😔❤️. You said if you
        don’t speak to me at night, your day feels incomplete😘… that your
        morning and night start and end with me 😚✨. You even told me you
        couldn’t sleep that night because we didn’t talk Awww babbyyy🥹… and that
        you only feel relaxed, peaceful, and able to sleep properly after
        speaking to me 😌🤗💞. I read everything… and I know it all came from
        your deepest emotions🥰 Because it was the first time you messaged me
        like that😍🥰😘 And honestly, it made me feel like I’m something magical
        to you… like your fantasy, baby ✨💗. That’s exactly how I felt😍😇
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Baby, when you say you don’t talk to other girls unnecessarily… even
        after working there for 2 years… it makes me sooo happy 😌❤️ It makes me
        feel like I’m truly special to you, like I’m the only one you’re
        connected to 💗 But when you told me you glance at other girls… it
        killed that happiness inside me 💔 I don’t want to control you baby… I
        just want to feel like I’m your only one 🤍🥺
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        23 November 2025 is the day you proposed to me… and that day I really
        fell for you 💗✨ Because of the line you said: “imagination alland real
        ayitt njn nighade koode athe bechil nighade kayy pidichond nighade koode
        hazelnut um kazhichond athinte oru kashnam nighalum kazhich inghane
        bechil nighade koode lifelong nadakkan venditt baby varuo nighade koode
        choichille”🥰🙈 Baby, you know one thing… this is the imagination I love
        the most 😘✨ I don’t even like to say this imagination with someone
        else — not even as a joke, not even for teasing 🥹 And baby… the last
        part, the way you gave your hand 🤝😘 I don’t even have to explain how
        it felt… In that moment, I just wanted to grab your hand and hold it
        tight 😘🥰💞 But I couldn’t…🥹😥 And even if you say it for teasing, I
        don’t like it…👊🏻 Because this imagination is only for you and me 🤍😘
        Only with you, baby… always 🫶😘😚😙😗
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        Baby, do you know how much these lines mean to me? 🥺💗 When you said:
        “Nink angane mansilakanam n undel enikk aakiyaa madi Njanaan ninde bsty
        , love , ellaaaaam"🥰 "Vere oraalkum ninne vitt kodkilla"😍 "Nee ende
        maatram baby"🥰 "Nee ende ellam aaan"😍 "Enikk nee matre ullu”🥰 Those
        words made me feel like I’m not “one of many”, but the only one in your
        world 🥰🫶🤗
      </div>

      <div className={boxStyle}>
        If I say honestly… I feel insecure when I think about “besty” 😞 It’s
        not because you did something wrong 🥹— you never did anything with your
        ex, I know that…😌 but the way you talked about your besty, the outings,
        pics, gifs… all of that made me insecure each time 💔😭 But when you
        said these lines, I felt better: "Ende lyf l aval oru nalla frnd aayrnu
        atre ullu, not anymore"🤗 "Bsty indaya relationship indavan padilla or
        thirich Randum same tym l paadillaaa"🤗 "Enikk nere samsarikkan
        pattathilla pinnallo idokke , idokke valiyya karyangalan"🤗 "But nammal
        naduvil inganonn illayrnu"🤗 Those words made the insecurity a little
        lighter "Appo video call l nee endaan uddesche 🤨" I don’t want to, but
        when I remember about video call, I feel insecure again 😣 because you
        mean that much to me 🫶💗 But all the worries and insecurity fade away…
        when I think about that bus moment you told me 🚌💗 you and your ex
        sitting front and back seat…🥲 and without speaking, just giving “taa👋🏻
        taaa👋🏻” like strangers 😂
      </div>



<div className={boxStyle}>

When you said those things about Naomi Scott…😏

“Avaleyum kanaan nalla rasaind”😏
and when I asked if it was right, you were supposed to say
“no baby, I said it by mistake, my eyes only see you and you are the only one beautiful for my eyes” 🤗💗
…but instead you said:🤨

“Adende enik thonan padille”👊🏻
and again
“Adil aval nalle ind atrannale njan parnje”👊🏻

Even after I showed my possessiveness, you still continued:🥹
“Nalleeeeeeeee rasa inddddd”😠
“Ha kanumbo kanumbo crush aavum”😠👊🏻
“Avalde pic wallpaper idanam, daily kaanaan”😡👊🏻👊🏻
“Appo daily crush adikkuvallo”👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
and then you didn’t even bite because
“Ndin avalk vedanikuum”😡😠👊🏻

Baby… you said all that like a full idiot 👊🏻😡🤦‍♀️
And the worst part — you will search her pic on Google on your own 💢😤
In that moment I swear I wanted to be there right beside you
and give you one punch on your nose 👊😡
That’s how much i possessive about you 🔥🥰

</div>




<div className={boxStyle}>

The moment you said
“Ende valiya oru agraham enda ariyo?”😳
I got fully excited to hear it 😳🤗

And when you said
“Ninde cheeks ne pidikkanam 😁”
“Ad pidich ju ju ju ju ju aakanam”
baby… I literally became love‑stuck right there 🥰😍🦋

Because it made me feel how much you admire me…😘
I felt butterflies… background song😜

And baby I want to tell you a secret…
I allow you to do ju ju ju ju ju ju 😁

</div>



<div className={boxStyle}>

Baby… when you said
“Alla enikk kitti”
“Avale pole oru sundari ne njan kandittilla”😘
“Avale kandappo full crush ayi… double crush…”😘
“Avlde kann ee night sky‑ile star poleya”😘
“Baby ne enikk atrekum ishtam”😘
At that moment baby…
I wanted to look into your eyes and ask, “say it again baby…” 😘
that’s why I called you… to get that feel 🥺
but you didn’t say anything on call 😔
I’m still excited and waiting for that day 🥹
to hear it directly from you ☺️💗

</div>




<div className={boxStyle}>
That day when my parents went to Coimbatore, I waited till 11 just to talk to you🥹, but you talked to your cousin till 12. I know they call rarely, but still… it hurt me 😔I felt angry and sad 😭, and you didn’t even notice I was upset for 3 days 💔😭
You forgot something that affected me so much. I just felt like you didn’t value me at that moment🥹😭
</div>









<div className={boxStyle}>
That day I was really upset because of the issue with my brother 😔. I messaged you first because I wanted to tell you, but when your mumma called, you didn’t even ask me what happened 🥹You could’ve spared one minute.🥺
I ended up telling my cousin and felt better🙂 I called you first, but you didn’t notice 💔

Nov 30, 2025 — the day I called you on Sunday at 9:35. You even lost your sleep for me,😍 and we talked almost the whole day😍 I felt like I could never get tired of talking to you🫣… the deeper it went, the more I wanted you ❤️😍

Your sleepy voice became my biggest weakness 😘
And when you proposed, I truly felt it🤗 It was warm, beautiful, and so real. The way your voice changed with every word felt like it came from your heart 😍😘— not just like the proposal you did on video. Awww babyyy😘 I fell for you even harder that day 🥰
</div>








<div className={boxStyle}>
Nov 30, 2025 — the day we had our first video call 🤗
Do you know how excited I was? 😳 I honestly thought you were a full-grown man from your voice and the way you talked 😅.
But after the video call, I realised you’re my only pookie babyyy 😘😁.

The way you looked on video call… omg, you looked like such a little boy 😭❤️. You have beard and moustache, but still something was missing.
That’s why you look like pookie, not Batman 🤣💕


And when you noticed my lips and said the upper part is heart-shaped… I blushed sooo much 🙈.But of course you didn’t notice it — because you’re a monnaaa 😂😁






</div>






<div className={boxStyle}>
The day you said you look at chicks based on your mood😡… in the office, outside, in traffic, on the roadside, even at the gym 😡👊🏻. I swear, I felt like spraying pepper in your eyes every time you said “I like that”😡

Babyyy Your eyes are only for looking at me, okay?🤨Not anyone else.
And that “mood” of yours… it’s an olakkada mood 😤
</div>







<div className={boxStyle}>
I love the way you say “kadavule”… it touches my heart so deeply 🥰
The way you say it goes straight to my heart, and that little smile you give after… awww babyyyy 😍🥰
It just makes me even more addicted to you 😘
</div>





<div className={boxStyle}>

The day I talked about besty and said😁 I would cut your call when besty came, 🫣I actually liked the way you reacted😘 The way you got angry😡😘… I was enjoying it in a cute way.🥰🤗

You said you will never say ‘I love you’ until now🤨
But you can’t control it 🤭— you still end up saying ‘I love you’😘 to me and calling me baby,😘 because it comes naturally from you… straight from your heart🤭😍

And babyyy, I only want you😊. Whether it’s as a besty or as a boyfriend or whatever it is… it’s only you🫵🏻 It’s not an option for me — you are my everything😘

</div>








<div className={boxStyle}>

The day you told me about the beach and the burqa girl, our call got cut suddenly😳. I was about to call you back, but you messaged saying your time was up and you were going back to work😞
But I expected you to say😔‘Call me… just 2 minutes, we’ll sort this out and then I’ll go back.’😢
You didn’t say that.😭

</div>







<div className={boxStyle}>

When you said your mumma was forcing you to marry and even sent you a pic of a girl who’s a nurse… it wasn’t easy for me to hear 😔.But I’m honestly so glad you rejected it babyyy🥰😍😘😘😘😘

</div>










<div className={boxStyle}>

When you told me about the burqa nurse your mumma suggested,👊🏻 you also said you would go to the beach with her just to make me angry😡🥹 You said many things, but I got stuck on that one word —'beach"🥹
And when I said, ‘You will hold her hand, buy biriyani, chocolate, spring potato…’ I was actually expecting you to say, ‘No, 😭that’s only ours.🥹 I won’t go with anyone else there.’
But you didn’t.😭

At that moment I felt really sad😭 You’ve mentioned things like looking at other girls, and that didn’t affect me much. But the beach part… it hurt me the most🥹😭Because the beach is something I always imagined as our place, our moment
So hearing you talk about going there with someone else — even as a joke — 😭genuinely hurt me😭

You didn’t realise it until I told you, and that’s why it hurts in reality😭

Baby, when I compare myself to something, at that moment it means I want you to prioritise me over anything 💔. But whenever I compare myself with anything, you give priority to the thing I compare 😞. Then you said you don’t need to compare anything with you. When I compare myself with Avengers, you went silent for 6 minutes, and I really felt like you like Avengers more 🥺. I know that Avengers is just a show, but I need to hear that I am the most important one in your life 💗. But you didn’t say it 😔.

Baby, I know what I’m feeling is not a crush or infatuation🫣. A crush usually comes from fantasy😁—imagining someone in a certain way, like messy hair 😁and ideal fantasy —but this isn’t that😬. Infatuation comes from constant caring and 24/7 attention🙂, even when someone is busy or away, and this isn’t that either😬.

My biggest fear is that if I express it and the answer is “no,”🥹 I don’t know how I would react🥹 or how I would handle that situation🥹

</div>










<div className={boxStyle}>
Babyy even when we fight👊🏻, there’s this moment I really love😁. When you tell me to smile and I smile like I’m in a close-up ad😁, the expression on your face at that moment🫣🤭—I love it🥰. And in the middle of the fight, when I try to act like I’m okay or that everything’s resolved😁, and you say you don’t want the act☺️, that you want the real me🥰… hearing that gives me butterflies😘,  even i am angry Babyyy😘


</div>









<div className={boxStyle}>

Baby, I don’t have a problem if you don’t message me at noon🥹. But when you ask me to wait🥹, at least tell me if you’re busy so I don’t keep waiting🥹. You already know I wait for you, and at that time it feels like you don’t consider me🥹, and that turns into anger🥹.
When I told you this, you said you already have “150 tension” and can’t remember everything. If i have any problems, you can tell me and we can solve it together🥹. That really hurt me😭. And the next day when you said “work nte idel..... pole kanikkalenn”, it hurt again😭🥹.
I know you may say things like that casually with friends, but it makes me upset😭.
